##
## 2.1 Dummy device : to publish message periodically
##
## - publish topic: /ham/spam/dummy/publish
## - published message: "Hello world."
## - publish interval: 30 seconds

#
#    [gateway]
#    name = "ham"
#
#    [[broker."sango"]]
#    host = "127.0.0.1"
#    port = 1883
#    username = "USERNAME"
#    password = "PASSWORD"
#    
#    [device."spam"]
#    broker = "sango"
#    qos = 0
#    type = "dummy"
#    interval = 30
#    payload = "Hello world."


##
## 2.2 Serial device : to publish message from serial connection
##
## serial port is /dev/tty.usbserial and serial connection bit rate is 57600bps

#
#    [gateway]
#    name = "ham"
#
#    [[broker."sango"]]
#    host = "127.0.0.1"
#    port = 1883
#    username = "USERNAME"
#    password = "PASSWORD"
#    
#    [device."spam"]
#    broker = "sango"
#    qos = 0
#    type = "serial"
#    
#    serial = /dev/tty.usbserial
#    baud = 57600 


##
## 2.3 Subscribe topic and output received message against serial device
##
## The publish data from the serial port with the topic of '/ham/spam/serial/publish'.
## And received message with the topic of '/ham/spam/serial/subscribe' is written to the serial port.

#    [gateway]
#    name = "ham"
#
#    [[broker."sango"]]
#    host = "127.0.0.1"
#    port = 1883
#    username = "USERNAME"
#    password = "PASSWORD"
#    
#    [device."spam"]
#    broker = "sango"
#    qos = 0
#    type = "serial"
#    subscribe = true
#    
#    serial = /dev/tty.usbserial
#    baud = 57600 


##
## 2.4 Publish status of CPU, memory, IP address periodically
##

#    [gateway]
#    name = "ham"
#
#    [[broker."sango"]]
#    host = "127.0.0.1"
#    port = 1883
#    username = "USERNAME"
#    password = "PASSWORD"
#    
#    [status]
#    broker = "sango"
#    qos = 0
#    interval = 10
#
#    [[status."cpu"]]
#    cpu_times = "user, system, idle, nice, iowait, irq, softirq, guest"
#
#    [[status."memory"]]
#    virtual_memory = "total, available, percent, used, free"
#
#    [[status."ip_address"]]
#    interface = "lo0, en0"

##  Note: in case of ip_address of all interfaces are required, use "all" as below

#    [[status."ip_address"]]
#    interface = "all"

##
## 2.5 HTTP API gateway
##

#    [gateway]
#    name = "ham"
#
#    [[broker."sango"]]
#    host = "127.0.0.1"
#    port = 1883
#    username = "USERNAME"
#    password = "PASSWORD"
#
#    [http]
#    broker = "sango"
#    qos = 0
#    enabled = true
